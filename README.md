# Little Silly Clicker Game

I'm making this little game with Html, css and JS to learn web dev. I've never made any project this "big" before,
and it is really fun to learn by creating something you enjoy.

The game gets to infinty with the second upgrade, I'm getting nuts and sleepy. I hate JavaScript.
